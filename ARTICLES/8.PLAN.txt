Great project — you already have **all the right tools** 👍
I’ll break this into **clear, practical advice** focused on **design + monetization strategy**, without jargon or fluff.

# 1️⃣ Core Strategy (Before Design)

### Your website is essentially:

> **A content library of valuable PDF articles, with free → premium conversion**

So every design decision should answer **one question**:
👉 *How do I turn a visitor into an email subscriber, then into a paying customer?*

Your tools already map perfectly to this funnel:

| Goal                       | Tool                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Domain & trust             | Hover               |
| Hosting & CDN              | GitHub + Cloudflare |
| Email capture & automation | Sender.net          |
| Forms                      | Formspree           |
| Live support               | tawk.to             |
| Payments                   | Stripe              |

# 2️⃣ Recommended Website Structure (Optimized)

You already have the right pages. Here’s how to **position them strategically**:

---

## 🏠 Home (Conversion-focused)

**Purpose:** Explain value in 5 seconds + capture email.

### Above the fold (VERY important)

* Clear headline:

  > *“High-quality PDF articles on [your niche], written for clarity and real-world use.”*
* Subheadline:

  > *Free articles + premium in-depth PDFs*
* Primary CTA:
  **📥 Get Free Articles**
* Secondary CTA:
  **⭐ View Premium Library**

### Design tips

* Minimal text
* Large typography
* One strong accent color
* No distractions

👉 Connect CTA to **Sender.net email form**

---

## 📑 Sommaire (Table of Contents)

**Purpose:** Show depth and authority.

### Best layout

* Category-based sections
* Each item:

  * Title
  * Short 1–2 line summary
  * Badge: `Free` or `Premium`

Example:

```
✔ Understanding X (Free)
🔒 Advanced Guide to Y (Premium)
```

This page builds **trust** and **desire**.

---

## 📚 Library (Free Content)

**Purpose:** Give real value and build habit.

### Strategy

* Offer:

  * Intro-level PDFs
  * Short but high quality
* Require:

  * Email signup to download (Sender.net)

### Design

* Card layout:

  * Title
  * Description
  * Download button
* Use **Cloudflare** for fast PDF delivery

💡 Free content should make users think:

> “If this is free… premium must be amazing.”

---

## ⭐ Premium (Monetization Core)

**Purpose:** Sell without sounding salesy.

### Structure

1. Who it’s for
2. What they get
3. Why it’s worth paying
4. Simple pricing
5. Strong CTA

### Pricing strategy (recommended)

* **Single PDF**: €5–15
* **Bundles**: €29–59
* **Lifetime access**: €99–149 (very powerful)

Use **Stripe Checkout**:

* Simple
* Secure
* No account creation needed

After payment:

* Redirect to **secure download page**
* Or send PDFs by email (Sender.net automation)

---

## ℹ️ About (Trust Page)

**Purpose:** Humanize + credibility.

Include:

* Why you created this
* Your expertise or experience
* Your philosophy (quality > quantity)
* Optional photo or logo

People pay **people**, not websites.

---

## ✉️ Contact (Support & Trust)

**Purpose:** Reduce friction.

Include:

* Formspree contact form
* Business email
* tawk.to live chat (great choice)
* Short reassurance text:

  > “Questions before purchasing? I usually reply within 24 hours.”

This reduces purchase anxiety.

# 3️⃣ Design Guidelines (Simple but Professional)

### Visual style

* White / light background
* 1 main color + 1 accent
* Plenty of spacing
* No heavy animations

### Fonts

* Headings: `Inter`, `Poppins`, or `Montserrat`
* Body: `Inter` or `Roboto`

### PDF preview trick (very effective)

* Show:

  * Cover page
  * 1 sample page (blurred watermark)
    This increases conversions a lot.

---

# 4️⃣ Monetization & Growth Strategy

### Phase 1 – Launch

* 5–10 free PDFs
* 3–5 premium PDFs
* Email capture everywhere

### Phase 2 – Email Funnel (Sender.net)

* Welcome email
* Free PDF delivery
* 2–3 value emails
* Soft premium pitch

### Phase 3 – Authority

  * Testimonials
  * Usage stats
  * “Most downloaded” labels

---

# 5️⃣ Legal & Trust (Important)

Make sure you add:

This matters a lot for Stripe approvals and trust.
