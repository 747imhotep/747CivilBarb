**Why PDF?**
We choose PDF because it respects attention. It allows readers to step away from the screen, read in peace, print and keep a copy, annotate freely, teach from it, and return to the text whenever discussion calls for it.

Why We Chose PDF
ABOUT PAGE VERSION

We chose the PDF format deliberately.

In a world designed for speed and endless scrolling, we believe some writing calls for stillness. PDF invites a different relationship with text — one that values attention, reflection, and continuity.

Our articles are meant to be read peacefully, perhaps away from a screen’s distractions. They can be printed and kept, written on, shared in classrooms or reading groups, and revisited whenever a discussion begins.

These are not articles for a moment. They are texts to live with, to teach from, and to return to over time.
