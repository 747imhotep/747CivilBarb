Hello,

Remember, yesterday we left the job here for a pause.
Please read it carrefully, so you can remember what we've been true.
If you have any question, feel free to ask.

Also, as you might see, it is wise to not push all answers at once.
step by step is better as we might encounter many problem on route.
Having said the, here's the record from yesterday:

Got it 👍
I’ve carefully reread the record, and I’m fully aligned with where we paused.

You’re absolutely right about **not pushing everything at once**. The foundation so far is **clean and correct**, which is exactly why this project is in good shape.

---

## ✅ Where we stand (confirmed)

From yesterday’s work, we know for sure:

* `.env` is loading correctly
* `entitlements.json` is readable and writable
* `grantEntitlement(customerId, email)` works
* Local file-based entitlement storage is solid
* No Stripe involved yet → **perfect isolation of concerns**

This means **Step 7.1 is complete**. Nothing to redo, nothing shaky.

---

## 🧭 What we will do next (calm & step-by-step)

We now move into **STEP 7.2**, but we will break it into **small, safe sub-steps**:

### **Step 7.2.A — Webhook skeleton only**

No Stripe logic yet.

* Create a `/webhook` endpoint
* Make sure:

  * Server starts
  * Endpoint is reachable
  * Raw body middleware works
* Respond with `200 OK` always (for now)

👉 Goal: *“Server can receive Stripe events without crashing”*

---

### **Step 7.2.B — Stripe signature verification**

Still no entitlements yet.

* Add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
* Verify the event signature
* Log `event.type` only

👉 Goal: *“We trust Stripe events”*

---

### **Step 7.2.C — Connect webhook → entitlement**

Very small change:

* Listen for `checkout.session.completed`
* Extract:

  * `customer`
  * `customer_details.email`
* Call `grantEntitlement(customer, email)`

👉 Goal: *“A real Stripe event writes to entitlements.json”*

---

### **Step 7.2.D — Test locally with Stripe CLI**

Only after everything above is stable.

---

## 🔒 Why this approach is safe

* Each step is **independently testable**
* If something breaks, we know *exactly where*
* No front-end, no success page, no premium gating yet
* Zero risk of corrupting entitlement data

---

## Before we continue (1 small check)

Just confirm **one thing** so I don’t make assumptions:

👉 **Where is your server code right now?**

* `server.js`
* `index.js`
* or something else?

Once you confirm that, we’ll start **Step 7.2.A** with the smallest possible code addition.

🟢 STEP 7.1. — COMPLETED
From yesterday’s work, we know for sure:

.env is loading correctly

entitlements.json is readable and writable

grantEntitlement(customerId, email) works

Local file-based entitlement storage is solid

No Stripe involved yet → perfect isolation of concerns


🟢 STEP 7.2.A — COMPLETED

We now know for certain:

Node runs in ES Modules mode ✔️

Express starts cleanly ✔️

Environment variables load ✔️

Server listens correctly ✔️

Routes respond as expected ✔️

This gives us a rock-solid backend foundation.

🟢 STEP 7.2.C — COMPLETED
